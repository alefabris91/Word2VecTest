IDEA 1: THE IMPORTANCE OF A DATA SET
Training the algorithm with different data-sets, noticing interesting diferences, finding a good way to present them graphycally

e.g. 
- gather 2 data-sets, one being a bunch of articles from a hyper-left-wing paper, one being a bunch of articles from a hyper right-wing-paper.
- train a separate model with each data-set.
- play around with the results:
	-> Look for similarities in couples of words: 
	   I expect for instance that from the right-wing data set the words immigrant and criminal are going to be 'closer' than the same two words learnt from the left-wing data set
	-> Look at single words and find the ones closest to them:
	   Take key words from hot topics (e.g. Europe, Refugee, ...) find which words are 'closer' to them (e.g. danger, opportunity,...?)
	-> Use clustering algorithms, see differences in clusters formed
	-> Anthing else that comes to mind!
- Find an interesting infographics-like way to present the information found.

Challenges:
- Obtaining data sets
- Presenting information

Perks:
- The ML bit shouldn't be too challenging (as it's our first project in this area I think this is important)
- Gain interesting and objective insight in how media can influence thought
- Chance to make project interesting for many audiences (easy to explain and grasp gist)
- Learn techniques to graphically present findings. If we do a good job and get some cool graphs I believe this is more noticeable than a 'boring' code-only project (e.g. for job interviews).
